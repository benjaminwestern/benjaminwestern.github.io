#### Certificates I have earned

I will be re-creating this page with some proper formatting and a better way to display the certificates. I am thinking of using a shortcode to display the certificates in a grid format. 

I don't think I will be using the PDFs anymore. I will just link to the certificate issuer's websites instead.
