A Passion for the IT industry, in my opinion, isn’t something you pick up. You're born with it. In my younger years, I was the king of pulling things apart and trying to understand what and how they worked. I didn’t know it back then, but I was performing a root cause analysis.

This drive for understanding has served me well in my later years as I am faced with bigger and bigger problems. The simple root cause analysis strategy has always guided me through. Not simply looking at the issue but understanding how and why it came to be.

I have a keen eye for detail and do not take anything at face value. Everything is created and implemented for a reason and I make it my job to understand these reasons and if possible, improve upon them. 
This continued passion for the industry and my way of thinking and doing has guided me through many aspects of IT and now I find myself in the warm embrace of the cloud infrastructure era and serverless automation. 

My day to day now involves identifying, understanding and automating everything I can, not only at work but in my home life as well. This is to give me as much time as I can to continue to learn and upskill.
A day I do not learn or improve is the day I have retired from this industry. 

I am always looking for new opportunities and new ways to connect and expand my horizons. Please reach out if you would like to chat!
